## Project: GASLIT-AF Genomic Variant Analysis Module

### Objective
To develop a comprehensive, robust, and efficient multi-threaded genomic variant analysis module tailored specifically for the GASLIT-AF framework. The module will operate on a Windows 11 environment (Intel 12700K, 80GB RAM) and efficiently parse large genomic variant datasets (VCF files), accurately identifying variants across an extensive list of relevant genes categorized by their biological pathways.

   - Detect additional potentially relevant variants using bioinformatics criteria aligned with GASLIT-AF.

3. **Parallel Processing and Efficiency Optimization**
   - Leverage parallel processing optimized specifically for Intel 12700K:
     - Default worker processes: 16
     - Chunk size per worker: 1,000,000 variants
     - Maintain a maximum of 64GB RAM usage, with a 16GB buffer for stability.
   - Incorporate effective memory management and variant chunking to prevent system overload.

4. **Caching and Performance Optimization**
   - Implement advanced caching mechanisms for intermediate analysis results.
   - Provide configurable cache management to ensure fresh and accurate analysis results.

5. **Detailed Analysis Capabilities**
   - Conduct variant analyses at both gene-level and biological system-level granularity.
   - Generate comprehensive summaries detailing variant frequencies per gene and biological system.

6. **Visualization and Reporting**
   - Generate interactive visualizations:
     - Chromosomal variant distribution
     - Variant type distributions
     - Transition/Transversion ratios
     - Top genes by variant count
   - Produce interactive HTML reports containing variant analysis, visualizations, and biological impact interpretations.

7. **Export Functionality**
   - Provide results export options in CSV format for external analysis, integration, and archival purposes.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Reliability**: Implement rigorous validation checks to maintain data integrity.
- **Maintainability**: Ensure modular architecture, clear coding standards, and detailed inline documentation.
- **Scalability**: Architect the module for easy addition and analysis of future genes and biological pathways.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Successful and error-free parsing of provided VCF file.
- Accurate detection and detailed reporting of variants across all GASLIT-AF relevant genes.
- Effective utilization of parallel processing and optimized memory management within specified constraints.
- Clear, insightful, and comprehensive visual and analytical reports.

### Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Environment Setup and Basic Parser Integration (1 week)
- **Phase 2**: Parallel Processing Implementation & Performance Optimization (2 weeks)
- **Phase 3**: Comprehensive GASLIT-AF Gene-Specific and Expanded Variant Detection (3 weeks)
- **Phase 4**: Visualization and Interactive Reporting Module Integration (1 week)
- **Phase 5**: Thorough Testing and Validation (1 week)

### Risks and Mitigation
- **Memory Management Risk**:
  - Implement memory usage monitoring and enforce strict chunk-based processing strategies.
- **Accuracy Risk**:
  - Conduct extensive unit testing, integrate external variant databases, and ensure expert validation of variant detection methodologies.

This enhanced PRD provides a structured and comprehensive approach, ensuring the successful, efficient, and maintainable development of the GASLIT-AF Genomic Variant Analysis Module.
